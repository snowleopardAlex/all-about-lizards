    HTML - HyperText Markup Language
    The content of the website, the skeleton of the website,
    headings, paragraphs, front cover of the book, opening and closing tags.
    CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
    How the websites look
    fonts, colors, layouts, backgrounds
    JavaScript - programming language, can manipulate HTML and CSS,
    full web apps 

    hex - hexadecimal values #45678n
    rgb - Red, Green, Blue rgb(0,255,0)
    hsl - Hue, Saturation, Lightness hsl(240, 100%, 75%)

    class is a group, can be used only once
    id is individual 

    THE BOX MODEL:
    Most elements are "block level" elements by default
    - they have a width of 100% of their parent
    - they have a height of 0
    - the height grows to match the content
    - they stack one on top of the other
    WE CAN CONTROL THE WIDTH AND THE HEIGHT
    MARGINS:
    - are used to control the position of an element relative to those around it:
    margin-left, margin-right, margin-top, margin-bottom.
    PADDINGS:
    - is used to control the positioning of content inside the element
    - it works like margin in terms of the long form and shorthand properties

    Margin = empty space
    Padding = more background

    Margin adds empty space to the outside
    Padding adds empty space to the inside

    BORDERS - add a border around your element. They are similar to a stroke if you are
    used to vector software.
    - it takes 3 properties to set a border:
    border-width, border-style, border-color
    You can also control the border of the different sides independently:
    border-left, border-right, border-bottom, border-top

    The total width and height of an element is calculated by 
    adding all the different parts of the element together. 
    The four parts of an element:
    - the content itself (what you set the width $ height on)
    - the padding
    - the border

    CENTERING ELEMENTS ON THE PAGE:
    Margins accept a set width but you can also use the auto keyword. Auto will automatically
    place all the available space on that side. 
    - If we use auto on both the left and the right, it will center the element on the page. 
    - This will not work on the top and bottom to center vertically. 

    CREATING COLUMNS:
    For the longest time, we had to use something called floats to make block level 
    elements go next to one another.
    It involved things sliding under each other and clears. It was not fun.
    Then we finally got something called flexbox. It;s a bit of a strange name, but 
    it was out first layout tool.
    By default, when setting display: flex on a element, all the children will 
    become columns. 

    SHADOWS:
    A big part of learning web development is reading documentation and 
    specifications
